## The Problem We Solve

**Superintendents are drowning in AI uncertainty:**

1. **Lack of Strategic Vision**
   - AI is transforming education, but most superintendents don't know where to start
   - Pressure from boards, teachers, parents, and students pulling in different directions

2. **Fear of Making Wrong Decisions**
   - High stakes: Student privacy, equity concerns, budget allocation
   - Rapid technology changes make it hard to choose the right tools
   - Career risk: Being too early OR too late to adopt AI

3. **No Trusted Resources**
   - Most AI content is tech-focused, not education-leadership-focused
   - Generic business AI advice doesn't translate to K-12 context
   - Need practical, actionable guidance from fellow educators

4. **Teacher Resistance**
   - Teachers fear AI will replace them
   - Need strategies to build buy-in and overcome resistance

5. **Budget Constraints**
   - Must justify every technology investment
   - Need clear ROI and implementation roadmap
